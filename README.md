# PyTorch Squeeze-SegNet Implementation

My PyTorch-based implementation of the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05491

I also created an updated version of the model in this paper using SqueezeNet 1.1 (the original model is based on SqueezeNet 1.0). 

These models were created as part of a project for CS682 at UMass Amherst; their accuracy isn't guaranteed.
